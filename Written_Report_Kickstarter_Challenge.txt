# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
# Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
# She wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
# Using the Kickstarter dataset that captured the various campaigns, we will visualize campaign outcomes.
# Come up with insightful recommendations for future campaigns

### Purpose
# The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise determine and 
# understand how the various campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and 
# their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset, we create and report on the 
# analysis and visualizations 

## Analysis and Challenges
# The main challenge is managing the associated data as it grows to hold the analysis and visualizations.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
# The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 
# However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
# Most successful outcomes have goals ranging from 1000 to 5000

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
# The excel file was crashing because of the volume of information

## Results
# The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 
# However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched
# Most successful outcomes have goals ranging from 1000 to 5000
